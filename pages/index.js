            The SF-BMR Ownership Program helps first time homebuyers who
            <br />
            are low, moderate, and middle-income. BMR homes are specified units
            <br />
            in San Francisco sold at below market rate prices. As I have
            <br />
            purchased a BMR home, I have learned the benefits and
            <br />
            challenges of going through this program. My book is a
            <br />
            updated guide to finding an affordable home in San Francisco.

            The best time to buy a home in San Francisco was 20 years ago, the
            second best time is now. The third best time is later. But
            regardless, itâ€™s the only time we've got.

            While most only look at the square-footage, the neighborhood and the

            preferences, BMR homes that are in large development projects, and

          In is common for a 1 bedroom condo, priced at $350,000, to have as
          many as 150+ applicants. Only one will win lottery and go on to
          purchase the home. The BMR applicantion is a number's game, but there
          are ways to get higher on the lottery preference to increase the odds.
